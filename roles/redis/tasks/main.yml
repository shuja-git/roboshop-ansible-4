#Install Redis
#
#dnf install redis -y
#
#Usually Redis opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server, So we need to change the config accordingly.
#
#Update listen address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in /etc/redis.conf & /etc/redis/redis.conf
#
#TIP
#You can edit file by using vim /etc/redis.conf & vim /etc/redis/redis.conf
#
#Start & Enable Redis Service
#
#systemctl enable redis
#systemctl start redis
